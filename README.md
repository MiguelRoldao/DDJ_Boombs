Very nice bomb game (BOOM)

Boombs is a platform/action/puzzle game.

To test the current state of the game, play the scene World1

**Bugs:**
1. No bugs known

**Implemented features:**
1. Player can move to the left and to the right
2. Player throws bombs
3. Click on bombs to detonate them
4. Bombs have a timer until automatic detonation
5. Throwing a bomb gives a recoil force to the player proportional to throw force
6. A bomb explosion applies a force to every physics objects within its radius.
7. Any bomb within the explosion radius of another bomb will explode as well (reduce timer to 0.1s).

**Need improvement:**
1. All implemented features seem fully functional.

* Player can only throw two bombs. One for each mouse button
* Instead of needing to click on the bomb for it to explode. A second click on the mouse button of the bomb detonates it.
2. Enemies
