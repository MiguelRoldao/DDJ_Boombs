Very nice bomb game (BOOM)

Boombs is a platform/action/puzzle game.

To test the current state of the game, play the scene World1

**Bugs:**
1. No bugs known

**Implemented features:**
1. Player can move to the left and to the right
2. Player throws bombs
3. Click on bombs to detonate them
4. Bombs have a timer until automatic detonation
5. Throwing a bomb gives a recoil force to the player proportional to throw force
6. A bomb explosion applies a force to every physics objects within its radius.
7. Any bomb within the explosion radius of another bomb will explode as well (reduce timer to 0.1s).

**Need improvement:**
1. All implemented features seem fully functional.

**Features to add:**
1. BOMBS:
* Player can only throw two bombs. One for each mouse button
* Instead of needing to click on the bomb for it to explode. A second click on the mouse button of the bomb detonates it.
2. Enemies
* Enemy type 1 - Blobs - They just crawl around and if you collapse with them on the side you die, the way to kill them is by landing on top of them
                         They have different behaviour based on their color (purple ones ignore cliffs, blue ones don't)
3. An actual plot - minor
4. Goal - minor
5. Obstacles: switches, doors, moving platforms, ...
